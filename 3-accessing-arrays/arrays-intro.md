# Arrays in JavaScript

An array is a fundamental data structure in JavaScript that allows you to store and manage collections of values. Arrays can hold various types of data, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

## Creating an Array

You can create an array in JavaScript using square brackets `[]` and populate it with elements separated by commas.

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const mixedArray = [1, "hello", true, { name: "John" }];
```
