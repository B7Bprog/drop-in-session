# Iteration in JavaScript

**Iteration** refers to the process of repeatedly performing an action or operation on a set of data, such as arrays or objects. In JavaScript, iteration is essential for traversing and processing collections of values, allowing you to perform tasks like looping through arrays, executing code for each item, and making your programs more dynamic and efficient.

JavaScript provides various ways to implement iteration, such as `for` loops, `while` loops, and built-in array methods like `forEach`. These tools empower developers to manipulate and work with data effectively within their scripts.
